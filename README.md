# koenfred19.nl

The "koenfred19.nl" website is a simple HTML and CSS-based project designed to showcase static information about my YouTube channel. This project is open-source and aims to provide a clean, minimalistic, and privacy-friendly web presence.

## Features

- **Simple Design**: A minimalistic design to focus on the content with no unnecessary distractions.
- **Responsive Layout**: Readable on all platforms, but not optimized.
- **Privacy-Focused**: No cookies, tracking, or data collection is involved in the functioning of the website.
- **Static Content**: The website primarily contains static information about my YouTube channel and related links.
- **No JavaScript**: A lightweight, secure experience with no JavaScript, reducing potential security risks.
- **Custom Error Pages**: the folder `/errp/` contains 4 custom error pages that you can set (manualy) in Nginx or Apache.

### Anti-features

- **No auto update**: Data on the site is static so you need to update data like subcout manual.

## Structure

This website is composed of:

- **index.html**: The main landing page containing all the essential information.
- **style.css**: The CSS file responsible for styling the website.
- **/img/**: Folder containing images.
- **/errp/**: Folder with custom error pages.
